# About This Project

Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.lester-lee.com">Lester Lee</a>, and this is my final project for a Spring 2022 course in the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/data-analysis-and-visualization">M.S. Data Analysis & Visualization</a> program at the CUNY Graduate Center. Thanks for reading!

## About the Data

All of my numbers are sourced from <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-us/funding/funding-our-schools">schools.nyc.gov</a>. The <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/financial/financial-data-and-reports">InfoHub</a> was very helpful, but there was a lot of sifting through slideshows and memoranda as well for data that wasn't as immediately accessible.
