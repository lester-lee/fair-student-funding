    title: `Where does the money come from?`,
    body: `Of that $38B, <span class="city">the city</span> provides 51%, <span class="state">the state</span> provides 34%, and <span class="federal">the federal government</span> and other sources provide the remaining 15%.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Where does the money go?`,
    body: `Not all of that money will go to <span class="operating-budget">the operating budget</span> for SY22. Roughly 20% is used for <span class="debt">other expenses</span>, such as paying off debts and contributing to pensions. In SY18, these expenses accounted for $6.5B of the $31.5B spent.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Where does the money go?`,
    body: `The remaining 80% is used to pay for all aspects of a student's education. About half of <span class="operating-budget">the operating budget</span> is used to pay <span class="teachers">teachers</span>, and the rest is spent on services like <span class="admin">administration</span>, <span class="food">food</span>, and <span class="transportation">transportation</span>.`,
  },
  {
    title: `District school budgets`,
    body: `Let's take a closer look at the funds allocated to <span class="district">district schools</span>, which accounted for 50% of the overall budget in SY22. That's $19B for ~1600 schools. If this money were distributed evenly, each school would receive about $12M dollars.`,
  },
  {
    title: `District school budgets`,
    body: `These funds are <i>not</i> distributed evenly, however; a number of factors play into how much money an individual school might receive in a given year.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Fair Student Funding`,
    body: `One significant factor is <span class="fsf">Fair Student Funding (FSF)</span>, which accounts for over half of the money district schools receive.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Fair student funding`,
    body: `These funds are unrestricted, and the principal can decide how this money is used. It might be spent hiring more teachers or purchasing art supplies. In SY22, FSF was the source of funding for $10B out of the $19B allocated to district schools.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Fair Student Funding`,
    body: `In an ideal world, schools would receive all of the money that was allocated to them -- but that does not always happen. In fact, SY22 was the <i>first year</i> since FSF was introduced in 2007 that there was enough funding to raise the minimum funding percentage to <span class="fsf">100%.</span>`,
  },
  {
    title: `Fair Student Funding`,
    body: `In addition to a <span class="fsf-base">base sum</span> of $225k, each school is allocated  dollars to schools based on the number of students enrolled, their grade levels, and their individual needs. This money follows students, so a student who transfers from one school to another will impact the FSF allocations of both schools.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Fair Student Funding`,
    body: `Students are assigned different weights based on their grade level and needs. All students receive FSF through <span class="fsf-grade">grade-level</span> weights, and are eligible for <span class="fsf-add">additional</span> money based on needs such as academic intervention or special education.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Fair Student Funding`,
    body: `Let's walk through two examples. A student in <span class="fsf-grade">grade 11 (1.03)</span> who was performing <span class="fsf-add">well below (0.40)</span> standards would have a weight of 1.43. Using the FY22 Per Capita of $4,223, that student's school would be allocated $6038.89 through FSF.`,
  },
  {
    title: `Fair Student Funding`,
    body: `A student in <span class="fsf-grade">grade 4 (1.00)</span> who was performing <span class="fsf-add">below (0.25)</span> standards and <span class="fsf-add2">learning English (0.40)</span> as a new language would have a weight of 1.65. Using the FY22 Per Capita of $4,223, that student's school would be allocated $6967.95 through FSF.`,

    title: `fair student funding`,
    body: `The total FSF allocation for a school would involve performing these calculations for all enrolled students.`,

  {
    title: `Bigger picture`,
    body: `That was a quick overview of how <span class="fsf">FSF</span> allocations are calculated, but it accounts for only ¼ of the money schools get in a given year, or ⅓ of the <span class="operating-budget">operating budget</span>. What decisions go into how the rest of that money is allocated?`,
  },
  {
    title: `Thoughts and questions`,
    body: `It makes sense that students with more needs should receive more resources, but I wonder to what extent those students actually see tangible benefits.`,

    title:`Thoughts and questions`,
    body:`The money that a student receives through FSF allocations ultimately goes into a pool of unrestricted funds that can be used at the discretion of the principal, who might or might not make the right calls.`

    title: `thoughts and questions`,
    body: `There are so many layers of bureaucracy involved, so many committees and hands that the money must be passed through, that as a person not in the system, I'm finding it near impossible to have a full understanding of everything that goes on.`,
  },
  {
    title: `thoughts and questions`,
    body: `What about the teachers of those students? How can they petitition for more resources? How can students submit feedback about the level of support they've been getting? `,

  {
    title:`thoughts and questions`,
    body:`Who is, and who should be, held accountable when student needs aren't met? How often are expenses unaccounted for? What slips through the cracks?  What's a sustainable and managable way to actually keep track of all these concerns?`
