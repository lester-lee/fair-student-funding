    title: `How are schools funded?`,
    body: `Public schools receive city, state, and federal funding. For the school year of 2021-2022 (SY22), the total amount of money received was $38 billion.`
  },
  {
    //title:`How are schools funded?`,
    body:`Of that $38 billion, the city provides 51%, the state provides 34%, and the federal government and other sources provide the remaining 15%.`
  },
  {
    title: `Where does that money go?`,
    body: `Not all of that money will go to the operating budget for SY22. Roughly 20% is used for other expenses, such as paying off debts and contributing to pensions. For example, these expenses accounted for $6.5 billion of the $31.5 billion spent in SY18.`,
  },
  {
    //title:`Where does that money go?`,
    body:`The remaining 80% is further broken down into separate categories. About half of the operating budget is used to pay teachers, and the rest is spent on services like administration, food, transportation, and building maintenance.`
  },
  {
    title:`District school budgets`,
    body:`Let's take a closer look at the funds allocated to district schools, which accounted for 50% of the overall budget in SY22. That's roughly $19 billion for 1500+ schools. If this money were distributed evenly, each school would receive about $12 million dollars.`
  },
  {
    //title:`District school budgets`,
    body:`These funds are not distributed evenly, however; a number of factors play into how much money an individual school might receive in a given year. The principal of each school is responsible for working with their School Leadership Team to create a plan for how that money should be spent. These plans have to be approved by superintendents.`
  },
  {
    title:`Fair Student Funding`,
    body:`One significant factor in the funding a school receives is Fair Student Funding (FSF), which accounts for over half of the money district schools receive. These numbers are calculated based on the number of students enrolled and the needs of each individual student at each school.`
  },
  {
    //title:`Fair student funding`,
    body:`These funds are unrestricted and the Principal can decide how this money is used. In SY22, FSF was the source of funding for $10 billion out of the $19 billion allocated to district schools.`
  },
  {
    //title:`Fair Student Funding`,
    body:`In an ideal world, schools would receive all of the money that was allocated to them. That does not always happen. In fact, SY22 is the FIRST YEAR that there was adequate funding to raise the minimum funding percentage to 100%. This was not the case for the 15 years since it was introduced in 2007.`
  },
  {
    // title:`Fair Student Funding`,
    body:`So how is a school's FSF allocation calculated? (walk through the math, update viz)`
  },
  {
    // title:`Fair Student Funding`,
    body:`This money follows students, so each school receives funding based on the needs of each of their enrolled students. Here are two examples of two different students, and how much money their school would receive based on the appropriate FSF calculations.`
  },
  {
    // title:`Fair Student Funding`,
    body:`Try calculating it yourself!`
  },
  {
    title:`Unanswered questions`,
    body:`While the goal is to be transparent, the money from FSF is only a small percentage of total school budget. How is the money calculated and spend in other areas? Are the weights for FSF fair? (elaborate, idk). this is nowhere near comprehensive; meant as a quick overview of some tiny aspecs of the nyc doe budget. there are so many things out there. why was there not enough funding? taxes? donors? are there places where funding can be shifted? where's the oversight? so many layers of bureaucracy? etc `
