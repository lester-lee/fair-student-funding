- fill in actual percentages & colors for waffle
- add hover tooltip to show percentage
- add highlighting to narrative to match waffle chart
- think about the FSF viz cause it'll be different from waffle, keep it visually similar tho
- style the actual page so it's not just text and boxes

use markdown instead of the copy.ts? maybe


- write real prose and add more detail to narrative

I grew up in the NYC public school system K-12, saw it as a place I had to be every day, homework to do, etc; it was not until I became a high school teacher that I started to think about it as a system - I see headlines all the time about school budget cuts, teachers burning out, moving money toward education, etc; but I realized that I actually knew very very little about the NYC DOE.

How much money was actually spent each year? How was it being spent? Is it that there's not enough money, or is the money being poorly allocated? I did not have any numbers to put to any of these ideas, so I decided to do some digging into the publicly accessible data to see what I could learn.

I'm not a subject matter expert on this; but I hope that the numbers I did find give a quick overview. I still have a lot of unanswered questions, but I feel like I have a little more footing to learn more about the intriciacies of this system.

# Where Does The Money Come From?
Taxes! That's the primary source of funding.
